# Cloud-hosted web application for a car dealership's review platform

# Requirements
The goal was to create a website where users could choose a Best Car dealership to read reviews from other users and submit their own. The site included essential features like a navigation bar and static "About" and "Contact" pages. It was developed using the Python-Django full stack web framework and deployed on the IBM Cloud using Red Hat OpenShift/Kubernetes.
